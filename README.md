# Pokemon Catching App

## Application Concept and Wireframe
### Application Concept
- This is a pokemon catching app
- We will be utilizing the pokeAPI for the pokemon data
- Full CRUD
    - GET: get all pokemon
    - POST: Caught pokemon will be posted to our array
    - PUT: Give the pokemon a name
    - Delete: Release our pokemon back into the wild

### Functionality
- We want a header at the top of the page to display the name of our app
- When the app loads, three images of grass will be loaded on the screen
    - when the grass is clicked, we will reveal a wild pokemon
- Once we select a pokemon, we will push that pokemon to our pokedex
- The pokedex will show the new caught pokemon
- the pokedex will show the name of the caught pokemon
- the pokedex will have a button to release the pokemon
- the pokedex will update when the pokemon is released

### Endpoints
- GET - fetch 3 random pokemon from pokeAPI (retrieve it on front/back)
- GET - fetch our pokedex
- POST - push caught pokemon to our pokedex
- PUT - change pokemon name
- DELETE - delete our pokemon from our pokedex
